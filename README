Base structure for all our Umbraco projects.

Includes:

Visual Studio project structure (needs improvement, Umbraco and the custom code should probably be seperate - at the moment, we have to put all dll's in libs/ and reference them, makes installing new packages a pita)
HTML5 Boilerplate (v2.0) structure.
Core Umbraco 4.7 installation
.Less integration
Title bar setup
Google Analytics setup
Best practice SEO options for all pages
Humans.txt specifically for TA (update if this is used for your own projects)
Comes with backup SQL database in /data (in future, maybe checking in the SQL script would be more appropriate?)
