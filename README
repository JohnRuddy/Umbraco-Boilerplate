Umbraco Boilerplate
-------------------

Umbraco Boilerplate is a base project for all our Umbraco client projects, as well as the excellent HTML5 Boilerplate, it features a bunch of common requirements for our projects, this is open source, feel free to steal, improve, or borrow what you need.

Includes:

1. Visual Studio project structure (needs improvement, Umbraco and the custom code should probably be seperate - at the moment, we have to put all dll's in libs/ and reference them, makes installing new packages a pita)
2. HTML5 Boilerplate (v2.0) structure.
3. Core Umbraco 4.7 installation
4. .Less integration
5. Title bar setup
6. Google Analytics setup
7. Best practice SEO options for all pages
8. Humans.txt specifically for TA (update if this is used for your own projects)
9. Comes with backup SQL database in /data (in future, maybe checking in the SQL script would be more appropriate?)
